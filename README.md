# **Procedural Animation with Unity Animation Rigging**

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates procedural animation in Unity using the Animation Rigging package. The setup allows a character to dynamically react to the environment without relying only on pre-baked animations.

**The implementation includes:**

Head tracking using a Multi-Aim Constraint.

Two-Bone IK for arms and legs.

Dynamic constraint weighting controlled through scripts for smooth blending between procedural and keyframed animation.

Example character prefab with a working rig and procedural behaviors.
