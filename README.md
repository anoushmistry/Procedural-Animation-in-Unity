# **Procedural Animation with Unity Animation Rigging**

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates procedural animation in Unity using the Animation Rigging package. The setup allows a character to dynamically react to the environment without relying only on pre-baked animations.

**The implementation includes:**

Head tracking using a Multi-Aim Constraint.

Two-Bone IK for arms used for environment interactions (similar to those in Uncharted 4).

Dynamic constraint weighting controlled through scripts for smooth blending between procedural and keyframed animation (In Progress).

Concrete States like Reset, Search, Approach, Rise, Touch each having their own implementation.

Example character prefab with a working rig and procedural behaviors.
